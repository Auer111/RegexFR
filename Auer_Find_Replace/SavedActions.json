/*
  Only a bit of a mess :\

  actionType 
    - this refrences built in functions within the app
    - the value of this string must be selected from the dropdown in the *run the Program > Edit Actions > Action Types (dropdown)
  actionName
    -pick anything you want here, it's used for the UI
  actionDescription
    -what does this action do.. or intent to do?
  fileName
    -actions rely on content from the data folder to extract and insert new data
    -add a new json file with the data you need inserted or extracted
    -currently only supports json with 'insert' and 'extract' properties
  scopeLimitingREGEX
    -the action shouldnt run on the entire file so first it will limit its scope
    -use one of the strings in the *run the Program > Edit Actions > REGEX Options dropdown
